# Systems Assessment Repository

This repository contains two microservices: `OrderService` and `InventoryService`. 
These services are part of a simple order management system designed for handling inventory and order placement.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Used for building both services.
- **Swagger**: For API documentation and testing.
- **JUnit**: For unit and integration testing.
- **RESTful API**: Communication between the services is done using HTTP-based RESTful APIs.

Note: This code is built using Java 1.8 and Spring Boot v2.7, instead of Java 21 and Spring Boot v3, due to time constraints and additional configuration requirements for the system.
